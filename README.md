# Telangana State Board Result Search Utility

This utility allows students of the Telangana State Board to search for their exam results when they have forgotten their hall ticket numbers. It also helps students find their college codes.

## How It Works

1. Students provide their name and a range within which their hall ticket numbers may exist.
2. The utility searches the entire database for the student's results.
3. A print window appears for 10 seconds, allowing students to print their marks memo.
